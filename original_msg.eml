Dear Joe,

I hope you are in the best of your health. I am writing this email to sort
out all the confusions and queries we are having collectively. As we
already know, our product is a requirement for your product and, as a
vendor, we are looking for a good and healthy relationship with you. We
have queries related to the process of your product launch and the nature
of technical assistance you want from our side. We will also like to know
about the procedure of transactions of our services, the growth analysis,
and the lead time of your product.

First of all, we would like to know about the nature of services you want
from us. Will they be nightly batch uploads or do we have to set up real
timelines? For your information, we will be more comfortable setting up
real-time or streaming endpoints for your product. It is more helpful for
our healthy relationship and the development of your product. In this way,
we will have a good collaboration with your technical team as well as for
our targets. The other thing we want to know is about the transactions of
our services for your product. It is totally up to your needs, whether you
demand it as a single schema or in different batches. I will prefer
multiple schemas only in case of unalike transactions. The last thing I
want to know is about your product growth and timelines. We only want this
information to confirm the availability of our services 24/7 for you.

Thank you!

Regards,
